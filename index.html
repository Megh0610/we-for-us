            <h2>Why Donate</h2>
            <p>Every penny donated makes a huge difference to the work we do, young children and their families. It
                literally can mean a case of life or death for some. While all gifts are gratefully received, a regular
                donation is best for the charity to be able to plan ahead to achieve its goals in relieving people from
                poverty.
